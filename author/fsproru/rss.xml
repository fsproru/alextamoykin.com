	     <p>Product development is a very complex task involving ideation, product and project management, design, software engineering and testing. As you develop more features, manually testing every feature becomes impossible over time. The number of bugs increases and the development cycle slows down. This post demonstrates how to automate your quality assurance efforts to increase the quality of your product and iterate faster.</p>

<h3 id="why-reduce-manual-qa">Why reduce manual QA</h3>
<p>Let’s take a look at a typical software development cycle with only manual QA.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/development_cycle_with_manual_qa.jpg" alt="Software Development Cycle with Manual QA" async="true" /></p>

<p>Let’s say you have two teams, a software development team, and a QA team. Software engineers only write application code, the QA team tests the developed product. Once a new release is developed under phase 1, the software goes to the QA team. The QA team executes manual tests by going through the user interface and making sure the product works right in phase 2. If a bug is found in phase 3, the QA team tells the development team how to reproduce the bug. Sometimes a product manager is involved to prioritize bug fixes to go in certain releases. As you can see, it’s a complex process involving communication between developers and QA engineers on a regular basis. In addition to it, there are only so many manual tests that a human can execute per day.</p>

<p><strong>Manual QA doesn’t scale well.</strong> As I mentioned previously, what happens after you develop more and more features, a number of manual tests increases and teams usually make one of the following decisions. They either hire more QA staff (which may be challenging for startups with limited capital) or execute fewer tests. Unfortunately, most of the companies I’ve seen go with the second approach which causes bugs, loss of customers, and lost revenue.</p>

<p>There is another way, have computers execute tests for you.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-automated-tests">What are automated tests</h3>
<p>When you write a piece of software, you want to make sure it works correctly. Let’s say, you implemented a login screen in your mobile app. After you’re done with your task, you may go ahead, stand up the app and try logging into the system. After you move on to the next feature, you test the next feature is a similar way. As you develop more features, you can’t possibly test all features you developed to date. It will simply take you too much time to test every feature manually every time you change the code. What ends up happening is that you break previously developed functionality without even realizing it.</p>

<p>That’s where automated tests come in. An automated test is a piece of code that executes your manual test. You write it once and execute it with one command any number of times you want. In the example of the login screen, you write a test that stands up the app and taps into a field with an invisible finger, enters some information and checks that the user is successfully logged in.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/development_cycle_with_automated_qa.jpg" alt="Software Development Cycle with Automated QA" async="true" /></p>

<p>As you can see from the following diagram, all 3 steps of software development happen during the same development phase. It involves fewer people, it lowers communication overhead, and increases quality (computers are more consitent at running tests than humans).</p>

<h3 id="how-to-automate-your-tests">How to automate your tests</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4 id="product-managers-to-provide-clear-requirements">Product Managers to provide clear requirements</h4>
    <p>Developing and trying to automate an undefined product is very expensive. If requirements constantly change, both, the application code and automated tests need to be constantly rewritten. In addition to it, it’s tough to identify the best testing strategy if you don’t know what kind of product you’re building. Make sure your product manager provides clear acceptance criteria for every user story.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="engineers-write-unit-and-integration-tests">Engineers write unit and integration tests</h4>
    <p>The problem with a manual test is that you need to have a human executing it every single time which is expensive. If you automate your test, you spend a little more effort upfront by writing it. Then, you have your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank">continuous integration</a> servers running tests for you as many times and as often as you would like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="dont-automate-every-single-thing">Don’t automate every single thing</h4>
    <p>It’s a delicate balance between what makes sense to automate and what doesn’t. You have to compare a time cost and a benefit. In some cases, an integration test gives you the most bang for the buck. In some cases, it’s easier to test an isolated piece of logic with a unit test instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="qa-engineers-test-interactions-between-systems">QA engineers test interactions between systems</h4>
    <p>If your product consists of multiple systems (like a mobile front end, a web front end, multiple back-end services, etc), it’s important to test all pieces altogether. Software engineers make sure every system is functioning correctly. However, it doesn’t really matter if each piece works as expected if the system as a whole doesn’t work. Cross-functional tests are the toughest to write. Make sure you automate the tests you execute most often manually first to be more efficient.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-words">Final words</h3>
<p>Automated tests are a great way to increase quality and iterate faster. If you keep your tests healthy, you can ship your software to production at any time. It allows your business to move quicker, iterate and learn faster. Writing automated tests is an important skill for every software engineer. It takes some time to develop and it pays off big time. Every system is different. That’s why you need to constantly challenge yourself with writing fewer tests that cover more functionality.</p>

	  <title>Serverless Microservices with AWS Lambda. How to Build a Robust and Cost Effective Back End product.</title>
	  <link>//serverless-microservices-on-aws-lambda</link>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>You probably heard a lot of hype about the serverless technology like AWS Lambda and microservices. After reading this blog post, you’ll know about pros and cons of using serverless microservices. You’ll also know how to implement an infinitely scalable back end using microservices on AWS Lambda.</p>

<h3 id="why-bother-with-serverless-microservices">Why bother with serverless microservices</h3>
<p>Before we dive into reasons behind using serverless microservices, we need to understand the difference between microservices and a monolith.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-monolith">What is a Monolith</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/monolith.jpg" alt="Monolith" async="true" /></p>

<p>A monolith is a single back end application. All code is usually located inside a single repository. The entire back end application usually runs on a single server. Even though it’s quicker to build a monolith back end in a short term with frameworks like <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> or similar, it has some disadvantages in the long run. As you probably guessed, it’s harder to have multiple developers work in the same code repository as it grows bigger. The biggest disadvantage is resiliency, if there is an issue in a part of the app, the whole back end is down and your app or a website is unusable.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-microservices">What are Microservices</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/lights.jpg" alt="Microservices" async="true" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices" target="_blank">microservices</a> architecture solves these problems. The entire back end consists of multiple small services communicating with each other over HTTP or through a messaging system like <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank">AWS SQS</a> or similar. Microservices take some time to set up. Once the core architecture is set up, you get the advantages like easy work parallelization and increased resiliency. Each developer can work on its own microservice without causing code conflicts with another developer. Each developer can develop a domain expertise allowing to develop features quicker and have a greater sense of ownership. In addition to the increased speed of development, if one microservice is down, the whole system is unaffected. Most of your app or a website functions as normal even though a small part has a problem. This way, there is no interruption of service and your business is better overall because of that.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-serverless">What is serverless</h4>
<p>Serverless is a concept that is developed recently. A traditional back end system is deployed and ran on a server or a group of servers. The advantage of a traditional server approach is that you have control over your own servers and the infrastructure behind it. One of the main disadvantages is an increased cost. Not only you have to hire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps" target="_blank">DevOps</a> or infrastructure engineers to build and maintain the infrastructure, you also pay for idle servers. Serverless technology solves these problems. With serverless pattern, you use a service that runs your code and maintains the infrastructure behind it. You only pay for the time it takes to process each request. AWS has a service for it called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank">AWS Lambda</a>, Microsoft offers similar <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/" target="_blank">Azure Functions</a>, Google Cloud has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/" target="_blank">Cloud Functions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-implement-serverless-microservices-on-aws-lambda">How to implement serverless microservices on AWS Lambda</h3>
<p>As you can see, serverless microservices offer increased resiliency, faster speed of development at a lower infrastructure cost.
Let’s figure out how to implement it on AWS Lambda.</p>

<h4 id="create-a-lambda-role-in-iam">Create a lambda role in IAM</h4>
<p>In order to run your lambda on AWS, you’ll need to create a role in IAM and assign permissions to it. Go to IAM, select Roles, click “Create new role”. Attach a policy based on what resources your lambda needs to access. AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole should work for a very basic case.</p>

<h4 id="write-your-lambda">Write your lambda</h4>
<p>Go to AWS console and choose the Lambda service, click “create function”. You can either choose from existing templates or chose to “Author from scratch”. Choose API Gateway as a trigger and click the “Next” button. As you can see on the next screen, a typical lambda consists of one function named handler. Here is an example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">exports</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">handler</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'Hello from Lambda'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Implement your business logic inside the handler function. Once the work is done, call the callback function. Pass null as a first parameter to your callback to indicate success. The second argument is the data returned by the function. If you would like to return a failure, return an error object as a first parameter instead. Here is an example of a lambda function indicating a failure.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">exports</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">handler</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Execution Failed"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It’s important to note that you have to call the callback function to tell the system that your lambda is done. If you don’t do so, the function keeps running unless it times out. Catch your errors and call your callback explicitly to handle errors.</p>

<p>After you finished implementing your business logic, choose a Role that you created in IAM previously and hit “Next”.</p>

<h4 id="api-gateway">API Gateway</h4>
<p>AWS API Gateway is another service from AWS that helps us to receive an HTTP request. It also helps us to connect the request with our lambda for later processing. If you didn’t read the post on <a href="/build-mobile-apps-faster-with-api-gateway">developing mobile apps faster with AWS API Gateway</a>, I highly recommend it. You’ll know how to simplify even more of your infrastructure to move even faster.</p>

<p>Go to the AWS API Gateway service. If you chose an existing API when you created your lambda, your lambda will be connected to the existing API. If you didn’t have any API before, a new API will be created. From here, you can customize your request, response, headers, etc. You can also create new endpoints and connect them with new lambdas. Every time a request comes in, your lambda will be invoked automatically.</p>

<h4 id="lambda-environments">Lambda Environments</h4>
<p>If you have multiple environments, you will need to create multiple versions of your lambda corresponding to each environment. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-lambda" target="_blank">node-lambda npm package</a> handles it out of the box if you specify the –environment parameter. node-lambda also helps you automate the deployment of your lambdas. This way you can develop and test your lambda locally. You can use your version control system. It also allows you to deploy your lambdas to AWS with a single command and your changes will be available in seconds.</p>

<p>Now that you have several versions of your lambda, let’s say hello-world-development and hello-world-staging, you can connect it to the same API using stage variables. Go to your API on AWS API Gateway, click on Stages. For each one of your stages, select your stage, go to the “Stage Variables” tab and create a stage variable named “environment”. For the development stage, set the environment stage variable value to “development”, set it to “staging” for the staging stage. Repeat the same for all your stages.</p>

<p>The last step is configuring the lambda name based on the value of the stage variable named “environment”. Go to your AWS API Gateway, create a new resource and a method, choose the Lambda integration type. In the “Lambda Function” field, specify the name of your function followed by -${stageVariables.environment}. For example, if the name of your lambda is hello-world, enter hello-world-${stageVariables.environment}.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/connecting_lambda_with_api_gateway.png" alt="Connecting Lambda with API Gateway" async="true" /></p>

<p>Next, you’ll be prompted by an alert explaining how to grant a permission to execute your lambda with all possible values of your stage variables. Copy the command from this alert, replace ${stageVariables.environment} with your environment name. Run this command from the terminal to grant permissions. Repeat for each environment name.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/lambda_allow_permissions.png" alt="Grant permissions for each lambda environment" async="true" /></p>

<h4 id="warm-up-times">Warm up times</h4>
<p>Another thing to take into consideration is warm up times. Since a lambda is ephemeral it’s not running all the time like traditional servers. The very first request usually takes several seconds to warm up any lambda. Subsequent requests are processed quickly. If you develop a real-time API with AWS Lambda, consider setting up Cloud Watch triggers to keep real-time lambdas always warm.</p>

<h3 id="final-words">Final words</h3>
<p>Serverless microservices is a cost effective way to develop a resilient back end faster. It takes a little work up front to set it up. Once it’s set up, you start developing your lambdas which are isolated and “infinitely” scalable. This way you can spend more time developing your business logic instead of supporting the infrastructure behind it.</p>

<p>The main takeaway is that you have to think about your application requirements today and tomorrow. I’ve seen so many companies implementing a monolith infrastructure in a hurry, getting stuck with it later, scratching it and starting over again. In order to set yourself up for success, your system needs to be extensible so you can change the pieces of it without affecting the whole system. Microservices is one way of doing it. Think about how you can make your system modular on your project.</p>

	  <title>5 Rules of Managing Technical Debt. How to Keep Moving Fast Today and Tomorrow.</title>
	  <link>//5-rules-of-managing-technical-debt-how-to-keep-moving-fast-today-and-tomorrow</link>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>If you’re a nontechnical person, you probably heard the terms like <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/project-management-and-technical-debt/" target="_blank">technical debt</a>, refactoring, and a hack before. Knowing what is technical debt helps you work productively with software engineers. This post explains what technical debt is and how to manage it efficiently.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-technical-debt">What is Technical Debt</h3>
<p>Technical debt is similar to credit card debt. You can spend some extra money now with a credit card. If you won’t pay it back shortly, you’ll be charged interest. If you don’t pay it off for a long time, the amount you owe increases drastically. This decreases your credit score which is hard to recover from.</p>

<p>Taking on technical debt in software product development is very similar to it. In order to accomplish a certain feature faster in the short term, a developer can apply a hack. If the hack is not replaced with a well made out solution, the code around it decays over time. In addition to it, software is built on top of other software. We all use libraries and operating systems. Technologies change and the system needs maintenance updates as time goes by, even if there are no new features being developed. If maintenance updates are not addressed, it also increases your technical debt.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/credit_cards.jpg" alt="Credit Card Debt" /></p>

<h3 id="why-taking-on-more-technical-debt-slows-you-down">Why Taking on More Technical Debt Slows You Down</h3>
<p>As you apply more hacks, your future development gets slower, you have more bugs in the product, and you get closer to the point when you need to start over. I’ve seen several companies in the past abandoning and rewriting their entire application from scratch since they were not able to make meaningful progress anymore.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-manage-technical-debt">How to Manage Technical Debt</h3>

<h4 id="get-on-the-same-page-with-engineers-and-stakeholders">Get on the same page with engineers and stakeholders</h4>
<p>It’s crucially important for everyone on your engineering team and for stakeholders to understand the implications of endlessly taking on technical debt. Set up and maintain high code standards and high test coverage on your engineering team. Make sure that stakeholders understand the technical debt concept and how it affects speed and quality of the product. Aligning everyone’s expectations goes a long way.</p>

<h4 id="pay-it-off-right-after-you-introduced-it">Pay it off right after you introduced it</h4>
<p>Every system has technical debt. Sometimes we need to focus on short-term goals. In this case, it’s ok to introduce technical debt <em>if and only if</em> you can pay it off right after you introduced it. The companies that ignore this important fact and continue to what seems like “moving quickly” will eventually slow down to a halt.</p>

<h4 id="revisit-your-architecture-regularly">Revisit your architecture regularly</h4>
<p>What worked several months ago will not necessarily work now. Especially in startups where businesses grow and change fast, it’s important to revisit decisions made in the past. Take your time to <a href="/why-nothing-makes-me-happier-than-deleting-code">refactor (or better yet, delete) code that no longer makes sense</a> in order to accomplish the needs of today. Bring it up with your team as a part of your <a href="/why-throwing-more-features-at-the-product-doesnt-work">retrospectives</a> and make action items to make sure it gets done.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/make_it_rain.gif" alt="Make It Rain" /></p>

<h4 id="pay-off-big-debt-incrementally">Pay off big debt incrementally</h4>
<p>When we deal with legacy systems, it may be bigger than a task of one software engineer to refactor it. In this case, make a plan on how you want it to look and change it one piece at the time. It’s important to maintain the vision of what you want this legacy system to be at the end.</p>

<h4 id="leave-the-codebase-in-a-better-place-than-when-you-started">Leave the codebase in a better place than when you started</h4>
<p>I can’t emphasize it enough. All that matters if everyone makes incremental progress towards making the codebase better. It’s impractical to stop feature development to get rid of all technical debt. Maintaining the right balance between feature delivery and paying off technical debt is the key.</p>

<h3 id="final-words">Final Words</h3>
<p>Every system out there has technical debt. Managing it effectively is a skill that can be learned. Technical debt is a risk. It’s best to avoid risk and sometimes you have to take it. As long as the team is disciplined about paying it off, it’s ok. At the end of the days, we all want to ship quality product and managing technical debt is a part of it.</p>

	  <title>Build Mobile Apps Faster with AWS API Gateway</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>As developers, we want to make sure we add the most value to our products. One of the main ways to add value to a mobile app is making a great UI. After reading this post, you’ll learn how to automate a common task of JSON parsing so you can focus on building a great UI (which is more fun to do anyway 😉)</p>

<h3 id="why-we-care-about-parsing-json-data">Why we care about parsing JSON data</h3>

<p>The answer is simple. Most apps are API powered. In order to make our apps useful, we need to fetch data either from our own back end API or from an external web service. A typical networking architecture for a mobile app looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/typical_networking_architecture.jpeg" alt="Typical Networking Architecture" async="true" /></p>

<p>The data is usually provided by a back end API. Which is consumed by our mobile app over HTTPS. Inside the iOS app, we have a request object responsible for sending and receiving network requests. Once the data is fetched from the network, it’s parsed from JSON and mapped to your model object. After the model object is ready, it can be used by a view controller. This data is now can be displayed in our UI.</p>

<p>As you can see, even a typical networking architecture is complex. There are 4 moving pieces that require integration between each other. The more moving pieces we have in the system, the more potential bugs we have in the app.</p>

<p>Imagine the world where our networking architecture is simplified and it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/simplified_networking_architecture.jpeg" alt="Simplified Networking Architecture" async="true" /></p>

<p>This architecture is simpler, the request and the JSON parsing components go away completely. Both of these components that you had to code yourself previously are replaced by an auto-generated API Gateway package. The only thing you have to do is to integrate this package with your view controller.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-api-gateway">What is API Gateway</h3>

<p>Before we dive into technicalities of integrating AWS API Gateway into your app, let’s figure out what API Gateway is. API Gateway is an architecture pattern. It allows a client (in our case a mobile app) to request data from a single location (an API Gateway). Instead of requesting multiple pieces of data from different places, API gateway takes our request and figures out which service request the data from. It allows for the micro services architecture on the back end. As an added benefit, both sides (the client and the server) can be changed independently of each other. Which leads to faster release cycles and faster product delivery.</p>

<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has its own implementation of the API Gateway pattern called AWS API Gateway. Here is how it looks:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/api_gateway_ui.png" alt="AWS API Gateway" async="true" /></p>

<p>There is a web interface available where you can define your API. You can define resources and methods like in any REST API. AWS API Gateway also has an API of its own available as an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/" target="_blank">HTTP API</a>. You can also access it from a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/" target="_blank">command line tool</a>.</p>

<p>The best part about AWS API Gateway is that you can generate a client side SDK. This SDK allows you to hit the API you defined and parse a response automatically.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/api_gateway_generate_sdk.png" alt="Generate AWS API Gateway SDK" async="true" /></p>

<p>As you can see, there are several options. You can generate an SDK for your Android app, a Javascript website, iOS in Objective-C (<a href="/objective-c-is-dead-why-and-how-to-build-mobile-apps-in-swift">if you’re still stuck in the 90s</a>), iOS in Swift, and Java SDK.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-integrate-aws-api-gateway-sdk-into-your-mobile-app">How to integrate AWS API Gateway SDK into your mobile app.</h3>

<p>In order to integrate the auto-generated SDK into your mobile app, you’ll need to write a little bit of code. Once you set up the initial infrastructure, updating it to support new endpoints is trivial. The code below is in Swift which you can use for your iOS app. Integrating it into an Android, Javascript or a Java app is similar.</p>

<h4 id="back-end-api-type-protocol">Back End API Type protocol</h4>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">protocol</span> <span class="kt">BackEndAPIType</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">createUser</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="nv">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nv">completion</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kd">@escaping</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">NetworkResult</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">User</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Void</span><span class="p">))</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s start with defining a protocol for our back end API. All our API classes will implement this protocol. In our example, it has just one function that creates a user with a name and a completion block. A completion block accepts NetworkResult. NetworkResult is a generic enum specialized with a type of our model (in our case User). Let’s dive into the NetworkResult next.</p>

<h4 id="network-result">Network Result</h4>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">enum</span> <span class="kt">NetworkResult</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">ModelResult</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nf">success</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">ModelResult</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nf">failure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">BackEndAPIError</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>NetworkResult is an enum with two cases: success and failure. The success case has an associated value of our result model. A failure case has an associated value of a BackEndAPIError which we define next.</p>

<h4 id="back-end-api-error">Back End API Error</h4>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">enum</span> <span class="kt">BackEndAPIError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Error</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">missingData</span>
  <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">mockConfiguration</span>
  <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nf">other</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">error</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Error</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The BackEndAPIError enum implements the Error protocol. You can define your custom errors here. For example, return the missingData error if your request came back with no data. If none of the common cases apply, return the other case with an associated value of the error coming from the back end. Now, most of our networking infrastructure pieces are defined, let’s start making concrete implementations of the BackEndAPIType protocol.</p>

<p>The first implementation of the BackEndAPIType protocol is LiveBackEndAPI. As you might’ve guessed by its name, this class makes live requests to the server. LiveBackEndAPI holds the reference to the client class coming from the AWS API Gateway SDK (it’s named MyBackEndAPIClient in our case). If you have multiple environments (like development, staging, production), you can define a different set of keys for each environment and pass it inside the initializer to configure it appropriately. Once LiveBackEndAPI is initialized, we can call the AWS API Gateway provided function called userPost on the client object. It will make a real HTTP request and give us back an AWSTask class containing either an error or a result. If your request is successful, your result will contain a fully instantiated model (in our case a User) with its fields mapped to the values from the payload.</p>

<h4 id="mock-back-end-api">Mock Back End API</h4>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The second concrete implementation of our BackEndAPIType protocol is MockBackEndAPI. It doesn’t make live requests and it’s used primarily in automated tests (both UI and unit tests) and for local development. It’s very useful to use a mock API for writing a robust and a repeatable test suite. You also get a benefit of being able to develop against a non-functioning or even non-existent back end API.</p>

    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The final piece of our network infrastructure is BackEndAPI. It has a static property called defaultAPI which returns us an instance of MockBackEndAPI or a LiveBackEndAPI depending on whether the process runs inside tests or not. The isRunningTests property is specific to each project. There are multiple ways of figuring out whether your process is running inside a test. One of the options is detecting an XCTest class inside the process environment or setting an environment variable of your own.</p>

<h3 id="thats-it">That’s it</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/funny_dog_2.jpg" alt="That's it" async="true" /></p>

<p>As you saw, we didn’t have to write any JSON parsing code (which is tedious to write). If you update your API, you just export a new SDK, add it to your app and integrate the new endpoints with your app. It involves significantly less effort and allows you to move faster.</p>

<h3 id="should-you-use-api-gateway-for-your-project">Should you use API Gateway for your project?</h3>

<p>It depends. I’m a firm believer in the value of working code. If there is already an existing API in your project, even if this code is old, as long as you don’t have to touch it, there is no need to rewrite it. What you can try is migrating towards using API Gateway gradually. You can try one endpoint, see how it goes and then migrate the rest.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you’re starting on a new greenfield project I would definitely give API Gateway a shot. Especially if you’re looking to implement the micro services architecture on the back end. AWS API Gateway also integrates well with AWS Lambda, which is their severless product allowing for cost efficient request execution.</p>

<h3 id="final-words">Final words</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/focus_on_what_matters_most.jpg" alt="Focus on what matters most" async="true" /></p>

<p>We covered a lot of things in this post. We found out why consuming data is important since most apps are API powered. We went over the API Gateway pattern and learned how we can simplify our app’s networking architecture to take advantage of AWS API Gateway.</p>

<p>I want to leave you with one takeaway. As software engineers, we play a crucial role in human society. We build tech products which millions of people use every day. In order to continue to do so, we have to focus on what matters most. In mobile apps, the most value is in the user facing UI and the data. The plumbing in between is important and the UI and the data are more important. Using API Gateway is only one of the ways of achieving it. Your project may have a different way of delivering the most value. Let it be your challenge,  think about the ways to focus on what matters most.</p>

	     <blockquote>
  <p>Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. - Antoine de Saint-Exupery</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what">What</h3>
<p>Wait, what? How can deleting code make you happy? Aren’t software engineers paid to write code? Great software engineers are hired to build great products. It indeed involves writing code and deleting unnecessary code makes writing new code even easier. This post explains how to leverage code deletion to your advantage as a software engineer.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>
<p>Deleting code benefits you, your team and your product. Here is why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It makes your product easier to use.</li>
  <li>It reduces code complexity, lowers compile times, and lowers test suite run time.</li>
  <li>It makes developers happier. Less code, fewer problems.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/less_code_fewer_problems.jpg" alt="Less Code Fewer Problems" /></p>

<h3 id="how">How</h3>

<h4 id="focus-on-the-core-experience">Focus on the core experience.</h4>
<p>It’s easy to get distracted by a new shiny feature of a competitor. It’s tempting to implement <a href="/why-throwing-more-features-at-the-product-doesnt-work">more and more features</a> to enhance core user experience. At the end of the days, your core experience has to work. This is what users will come back in your app for. More additional features will distract your user from core experience which you don’t want to do.</p>

<h4 id="use-analytics-to-determine-what-users-actually-use-delete-the-rest">Use analytics to determine what users actually use, delete the rest.</h4>
<p>If you don’t have analytics in your app, you make your product and business decisions based on assumptions. In order to make a real difference in your product development, choose your direction on actual metrics. This way you can see the effect of every feature you ship. Take a look at how the app is used. It may turn out that some portions of the app or a website aren’t used as much. At this point, you can either delete it to simplify the user experience. Alternatively, it gives you a chance to rebuild the under-performing areas of the app if it makes sense to do so.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-dont-need-it-delete-it">If you don’t need it, delete it.</h4>
<p>Over and over again, I hear the concern about leaving existing code in place just in case we need it in the future. The truth is, you don’t need it most of the time. Even if you’ll need it in the future, your system will change so significantly over time so you’ll need to rewrite it anyway. At the end of the days, if you need your old code, your version control system will help you with that. This mentality goes well with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it" target="_blank">YAGNI principle</a>.</p>

<h4 id="stick-to-the-kiss-principlehttpsenwikipediaorgwikikissprincipletargetblank">Stick to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank">KISS principle</a>.</h4>
<p>Keeping things simple is the best thing you can do when building complex systems. Even if building extra capabilities for your product is a more exciting thing to do from a software development perspective, no one benefits from an over-engineered system. Complex systems are hard to use, hard to maintain and it’s prone to bugs. Keep your code simple and always seek opportunities to simplify already complicated pieces of your software architecture. It will pay big dividends over time.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kiss.gif" alt="Kiss" /></p>

<h3 id="final-words">Final words</h3>
<p>At the end of the days, it doesn’t really matter how much code you write. What matters is how fast you can build quality software that drives the business towards success. It’s not fun to be a part of failing startup with great technology that doesn’t help the business. Nor it’s fun to be at the growing business and not being able to iterate fast because of high technical debt. In order to maintain the right balance, you need to determine what’s important for the business. Make important things work really well and leave the rest behind.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>
<p>Hiring is important. Your team is the most valuable asset of the company. Products come and go, markets and technologies change. The team is what makes a company a success! If you’re running a tech company, your software engineers are going to play a vital part in your success. This post explains how to hire best engineers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better. - Ed Catmull. Co-Founder of Pixar and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812993012/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=howtoprogramb-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0812993012&amp;linkId=4f4cc7ef29a896fb2d82c61b4f0a582a" target="_blank">Creativity, Inc</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="sourcing-candidates">1. Sourcing candidates</h3>
<p>The first step, source a lot of candidates. Hiring pipeline is a funnel. There should be a lot of candidates at the very top of the funnel. Only the best engineers who are the right fit will get the offer. In my experience, from 10 engineers there is 1 decent engineer. Also, keep in mind that about 50% of candidates accept the offer. In order to find the right people, source a lot of candidates. Here are the places to look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>References.</strong> This is the most effective way to get candidates. If a person you trust recommends you an engineer whom he/she worked with before, you should contact this candidate as soon as possible. Great developers want to work with more great developers and this kind of candidates tend to fit well culturally.</li>
  <li><strong>LinkedIn.</strong> Look at some top developer profiles on LinkedIn. On each profile, there is usually a section called “People Also Viewed” with even more profiles. You can click on each of them and then, rinse, repeat. Reach out to developers asking for their interest. You never know who is looking or who is ready to move on.</li>
  <li><strong>Job Postings.</strong> Create a job posting on <a href="https://jobs.github.com/post#create" target="_blank">Github</a>, <a href="http://talent.stackoverflow.com/jobs/create?cw=1" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> or <a href="https://angel.co/recruiting" target="_blank">Angel List</a>. Keep in mind, the market is hot, so make sure your posting looks attractive.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="phone-screen">2. Phone screen</h3>
<p>Now that you got in touch with your prospective candidates, schedule a phone screen with them. You’ll have to do a lot of phone screens so it’s important to keep it efficient. I usually do a 45-minute call which is broken down into 3 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ice-breaker.</strong> I tell about the opportunity and ask questions about the resume. Starting with a question like “How much do you know about the company X ?” can save you some time so you can focus on filling the gaps. Then I ask a couple of questions about the resume. The key here is to keep your questions focused. In this case, you can verify whether they really have the experience listed.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple coding exercise.</strong> I usually do interviews over a video chat like Google Hangout. I ask a candidate to share the screen and implement a simple coding challenge. The candidate is encouraged to ask questions and walk me through the implementation. This step is meant to be a conversation rather than coding in silence. Seeing a person code in real time reveals a lot of things like debugging skills, algorithm choices and communication skills.</li>
  <li><strong>Finishing questions.</strong> This is where high-level architecture or framework knowledge questions go. At the end of the interview, I answer questions the candidate has for me.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-house-interview">3. In-house interview</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/job_interview_prank.gif" alt="Job interview prank" async="true" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be mindful about your and candidate’s time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bring the candidate on-site to show them around the office and meet the team. Your team’s time is valuable, so is the candidate time. Some companies prefer to have a full day on-site interview. I usually keep it short with just two rounds of interviews with developers. Developers go in pairs. Make sure the team synced up before the interview and everybody knows which questions to answer. It’s important to probe for these things:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Code quality.</strong> The most important thing is to figure out if they can write great quality code in a reasonable timeframe. It’s good to give a candidate a moderately complex problem and work with them on coding a solution. You want to make sure the candidate makes reasonable choices. It’s ok to make minor mistakes if they can see it and fix it. Keep in mind that the code you see during the interview will be the code you’ll see in your code base if the person gets hired.</li>
  <li><strong>Cultural fit.</strong> Would you want to work next to this person every day? Does the candidate communicate well? Do you like the person’s attitude? If you’re interviewing a person, these are the questions to ask yourself.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Treat the candidate the same way you would like to be treated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Developer time is a finite resource. If it’s clear that the person is not a fit from the first pair of interviewers, tell the candidate so and stop the interview. Have you ever been in the interview where you didn’t hear anything back? It’s not fun to be in this situation so treat people the way you would like to be treated. Tell the candidate why it’s not the right fit and what they can improve. If you see the potential, tell the candidate that you would like to touch base in the next 6 to 12 months to see if the situation is improved. If you’re not comfortable delivering this feedback in person on the day of the interview then walk out the candidate and follow up the next day over the phone or email.</p>

<p>On the other end, if the candidate made it to the end of the in-house interview, communicate to the candidate that the interview is finished. Tell the candidate that you’ll get back to him/her in the next couple of days.</p>

<h3 id="references">4. References</h3>
<p>Request at least 3 references and call each of them. Ask them about their experience working with the candidate. Ask what the person is good at and what he/she needs to improve. Keep in mind that it will take time since people have their own schedules. It’s important to move quickly. If you’re super excited about the candidate you can make an offer contingent on a reference check.</p>

<h3 id="offer">5. Offer</h3>
<p>You should be excited about the candidate you would like to hire. Get all participants in the room, have each interviewer to write down their outcome. Each person’s outcome should be unaffected by anybody’s opinion. Go around the room where each person reveals the score with the reasoning behind it. If there is a consensus in the room, it’s a pretty easy decision to make. If you’re on the fence, it may be tempting to bring the candidate for another round for more information. From my experience, you don’t get more information after the in-house interview. Make a decision with the information you have. If you’re not sure, the answer is no.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, great software engineers are not on a job market for a long time. You have to move quick. After you know the outcome, communicate it to the candidate. If the answer is no, explain why politely. If the answer is yes, communicate it to the candidate and send the candidate an offer letter. Give a candidate some time to think and follow up on a decision. Good luck!</p>

<h3 id="final-words">Final words</h3>
<p>Hiring is a long play game. You should never hire people you don’t like. Even if you have a lot of work to do, it’s never worth it. Be patient and keep interviewing. Every person counts and hiring the right software engineer will greatly increase your chances of success!</p>

	  <title>Objective-C Is Dead, Why and How To Build Mobile Apps in Swift.</title>
	  <link>//objective-c-is-dead-why-and-how-to-build-mobile-apps-in-swift</link>
	  <author>Alex Tamoykin</author>

	  <guid>//objective-c-is-dead-why-and-how-to-build-mobile-apps-in-swift</guid>
	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Even though there is a plenty of Objective-C out there, if you’re not writing Swift now, you’re way behind as a <a href="/10-steps-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer/">software engineer</a> and as an engineering organization. This blog post goes over challenges behind using the Swift programming language at a legacy project and how to overcome them.</p>

<h4 id="why-swift">Why Swift</h4>
<ul>
  <li>At this point, Swift is becoming mainstream for iOS app development. It reached a stable place and the API doesn’t change much. There is a plenty of Swift packages.</li>
  <li>More and more <a href="http://crunchybagel.com/building-command-line-tools-with-swift/" target="blank">command line tools</a> are written in Swift outside of mobile app development.</li>
  <li>Swift is picking up momentum on the server-side. There are several server-side swift frameworks available already and <a href="https://swift.org/server-apis/" target="_blank">Apple is now really pushing for server-side Swift</a>.</li>
  <li>Swift is a better language than Objective-C and <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2920333/mobile-development/swift-vs-objective-c-10-reasons-the-future-favors-swift.html" target="blank">this awesome post explains pretty well why</a>. It’s faster, safer, more expressive, and more fun to work with.</li>
  <li>Knowing Swift becomes a requirement for a mobile app developer. If it’s not a requirement for the job you’re applying for, you probably don’t want to work there anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that you may be using Objective-C and you became very efficient at it. It’s time for a change, so be a <a href="/why-developer-athletes-get-the-best-engineering-jobs">developer athlete</a> and let it go.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/let_it_go.gif" alt="Let it go" /></p>

<h4 id="starting-a-new-project-in-swift">Starting a new project in Swift</h4>

<p>Back in August 2014, when I was running the engineering team at AwesomenessTV, I wouldn’t start a new project in Swift. We decided to start a project in Objective-C and migrate to Swift overtime. Here is a quick presentation from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/LASwift/events/204003792/" target="_blank">LA Swift Meetup</a> explaining the reasoning behind it:</p>

<script async="" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="f5daa57536c84933814d37a70730385f" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

<p>Fast forward a couple of years and my decision would be completely opposite. If you’re starting a new project now, don’t hesitate and choose the Swift language.</p>

<h4 id="migrating-an-existing-objective-c-project-to-swift">Migrating an existing Objective-C project to Swift</h4>

<p>Since Objective-C has been around for almost 20 years, there is a lot of useful code written. Chances are that your existing project is either written in Objective-C entirely or most of the project is written in Objective-C. No worries, here are the steps to migrate it to Swift seamlessly:</p>

<h5 id="commit-to-the-swift-migration-as-a-team">Commit to the Swift migration as a team</h5>
<div class="left-align">
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385528752/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0385528752&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=howtoprogramb-20&amp;linkId=47210f7dd43a00a4e662ed2e85cb6129"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=0385528752&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=howtoprogramb-20" /></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=howtoprogramb-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0385528752" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
</div>

<p>Hopefully, you’re on the team with like-minded innovative app developers. If not, there is some work that needs to be done. Depending on your team, you may hold a team meeting where you bring your Swift migration proposal. Come prepared with a detailed plan (we’ll go over that in a bit). If you follow the <a href="/why-throwing-more-features-at-the-product-doesnt-work">Agile Methodology</a>, the best place to bring it up is a retrospective meeting. If you have some old school developers on the team, have a casual conversation with each of them separately. Tell them about your plan and ask them for their opinion. They will feel invested in the outcome. A great book on the topic is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385528752/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=howtoprogramb-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0385528752&amp;linkId=b6b63d68a2b2afdb94968948f614f4ef" target="_blank">Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard</a>.</p>

<h5 id="start-writing-tests-and-new-code-in-swift">Start writing tests and new code in Swift</h5>
<p>Migrating the entire Objective-C codebase to Swift in one shot doesn’t make sense. The benefit of re-writing things in Swift is to improve your code and to make a solid foundation for future changes. If there is some solid Objective-C code in the app that works well and you don’t have to modify it, it doesn’t make sense to re-write it. Focus on new code. The two obvious candidates are your new tests and new code files. Set up your <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html" target="_blank">Objective-C bridging header</a>, start writing new files and in Swift and just reuse the existing Objective-C code. Create <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Extensions.html" target="_blank">Swift Extensions</a> for an already existing Objective-C class if it makes sense.</p>

<h5 id="if-youre-modifying-an-objective-c-file-convert-it-to-swift">If you’re modifying an Objective-C file, convert it to Swift</h5>
<p>If your files are small in size, converting an Objective-C file to Swift may be a straightforward talk as you’re in it. I do it pretty frequently and it’s a great way to make progress on the Swift migration without sacrificing feature velocity.</p>

<h4 id="final-words">Final words</h4>
<p>It’s the best time to be an iOS mobile app developer. Swift is a fantastic programming language and the mobile app industry is a great place to be in. There are new exciting mobile apps built every day. In order to make this world better, we need a better language. So leave the legacy behind and innovate!</p>

	  <title>Why Developer Athletes Get The Best Engineering Jobs</title>
	  <link>//why-developer-athletes-get-the-best-engineering-jobs</link>

	  <pubDate>2016-11-13T00:00:00-08:00</pubDate>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <h3 id="who-is-a-developer-athlete">Who is a developer athlete</h3>

<p>Let’s first define a developer athlete. As I previously outlined in the <a href="/10-steps-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer/">10 Steps To Become a Senior Software Engineer post</a>, you can become very efficient at computer programming, then what ? Once you know your techstack in and out, it’s time to expand your horizons and become a developer athlete. A developer athlete can dive into any techstack and be productive very fast by building on existing experience in computer engineering.</p>

<h3 id="why-would-you-want-to-be-a-developer-athlete">Why would you want to be a developer athlete</h3>

<p>A developer athlete is a generalist computer software engineer. These kind of players are much more valuable on the team because of the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Techstacks change frequently. The whole entire techstack changes completely every 5 years. I went through several techstack changes in my career.</li>
  <li>The company (especially a startup) changes it’s course frequently. In order to stay agile, you have to be open to solving different problems and to using new tools. Developer athletes occupy the best engineering jobs and get the best <a href="/software-engineer-salary-dollar-dollar-bill-yall">software engineer salary</a>.</li>
  <li>Operating in one techstack becomes boring over time. Great players become bored from doing the same thing over and over again. They branch out into a different technology to keep themselves engaged at work.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-do-you-become-an-athlete">How do you become an athlete</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/cat_workout.gif" alt="Cat workout" /></p>

<h4 id="demonstrate-the-can-do-anything-attitude">1. Demonstrate the “can do anything” attitude</h4>

<p>You have to get outside of your comfort zone and to be open to diving into any technology. It sounds crazy, and you’ll be surprised how far apart it puts you against your competition. You make your team a lot stronger and lot more resilient by being able to deliver quality work in any techstack. It is true that you don’t go deep into a specific technology and it doesn’t matter as much since you’re already an expert in one techstack. At some point, your team will lose an engineer and the ability to jump in and help out is crucial for the business.</p>

<h4 id="pay-attention-to-the-basics">2. Pay attention to the basics</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Focus on fundamentals, the rest will change anyway</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you get comfortable with changing techstacks, you’ll see that fundamentals stay the same in every single one of them. Whether you’re a web developer writing your next project in Javascript or doing app development in Swift, the fundamentals are the same. All programs are compiled into machine code that gets executed on a processor. It’s true that you don’t have to worry as much about some low level aspects like memory management when using high level programming languages. You still need to understand what happens under the hood in order to build software that performs well.</p>

<h4 id="stay-open-minded">3. Stay open minded</h4>

<p>One phrase that I often hear from junior developers is: “I hate language X and I will never do it.”. Never say never. If you would like to step up your game, you need to appreciate a particular technology for it’s strengths. You’ll also need to know it’s weaknesses. Even though a lot of people “hate” PHP, we wouldn’t be here without it. Most of the software problems that I’ve seen are not about the language you use, it’s about your architecture.</p>

<h4 id="stay-current">4. Stay current</h4>

<p>I learn at least one new programming language and one new framework a year. I picked up Swift 3.0 as a language and Android as a whole new platform this year. Once you master the fundamentals and become efficient at one techstack, you’ll start recognizing patterns. It helps you to take your learning speed onto the whole another level where you can pick up pretty much any techstack quickly. The key here is to pay attention to tech industry dynamics and play around with new technologies. You never know, it may be the best tool for the job on your next project.</p>

<h4 id="exercise-eat-and-sleep-well">5. Exercise, eat and sleep well</h4>

<p>As you grow, your responsibilities grow with it so as the impact of your decisions. The ability to be present in a high stakes meeting or the ability to focus while coding is key. Think of yourself as an athlete that needs rest before the next race. Your brain needs rest while sleeping. Your body needs an exercise and the right nutrition to operate well. All these systems are connected and it affects your ability to execute during the day.</p>

	  <title>Ship On Time: How to Give Accurate Software Estimates</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Imagine your CEO casually asks you: “Hey, how long would it take you to implement the feature X?”. You don’t want to disappoint your CEO and you’re feeling pressured for an answer, so you respond: “It’s pretty simple, I’ll get it done in a week.”. The CEO is happy, you’re fired up. As you’re working on the feature, you find our that you have an external dependency that makes it tricky. The code needs to be refactored and there are no tests. At the end of the week, the CEO shows up again. He/she already sold it to a prospective client but you now need to deliver bad news. We’ve all been there. After reading this post, you’ll know how to prevent it from happening.</p>

<h2 id="why-software-estimates-are-important">Why software estimates are important</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Stakeholders need it to make business decisions</li>
  <li>It helps you understand what you need to build</li>
  <li>It helps you understand how you need to build it</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-you-can-estimate">How you can estimate</h2>
<p>One of my old bosses from Russia brought up a simple formula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think of a worst possible case, double it and you’ll still be wrong. - My Old Boss</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though it sounds like a joke, there is something we can learn from it. You can’t predict it exactly right, period. You may know a lot of things, but you don’t know what you don’t know. A software is built on top of other software and you can’t control it completely. There is a technique that I developed over the years that will help you to get it very close. Here are the steps:</p>

<h3 id="gather-requirements">Gather requirements</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t know where you are going, you’ll end up someplace else. - Yogi Berra</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The minute someone asks you about a new feature, ask questions to clarify details. It will lead to more questions and unknowns. Rinse, repeat until you get all your questions answered.</p>

<p>Here is an example. Let’s say we would like to build new profile screen for your user. How should this screen look? Where should the avatar be located? What color is the font, what size it is ? How long should a bio be ? Should we allow editing the bio? Etc.</p>

<h3 id="break-it-down">Break it down</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/break_it_down.gif" alt="Break It Down" async="true" /></p>

<p>Now that you have all your questions answered, it’s time to do your homework and break it down. The goal is to break down every individual requirement into small tasks so you can clearly estimate each of them. If your estimate seems high, break down a big task into a set of smaller tasks. Keep breaking it down until your estimate is clear and reasonable. Some people prefer doing it in hours, some people use points. We’ll use hours in this example to keep it simple.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Profile screen scaffold - 0.5 hour</li>
  <li>Serve a user avatar URL from the back end - 1 hour</li>
  <li>Display an avatar image centered on the screen - 0.5 hour</li>
  <li>Serve a user bio from the back end - 0.5 hour</li>
  <li>Display a bio on the profile screen - 0.5 hour</li>
  <li>Create an edit bio endpoint on the back end - 1 hour</li>
  <li>Present a new edit bio screen when user taps on a bio - 1 hour</li>
  <li>Send a bio request and update the bio on the profile screen - 1.5 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: 6.5 hours</p>

<p>This is just a hypothetical example. Your estimates may be different depending on the state of your app, your familiarity with the codebase or even the team you’re on. Factor risk in your individual estimates.</p>

<h3 id="estimate">Estimate</h3>
<p>If you made it to this point, you’re in a pretty good shape. The hardest part is already done and all you need to do is to plug numbers into a simple formula:</p>

<p><strong>Estimate = Total + (Risk Factor * Total)</strong></p>

<p>Yes, a risk factor. Always factor in a risk factor. There is always something that you didn’t think of or something is outside of your control. The exact number varies from project to project. I’ve seen projects executed with a 20% risk factor with an established team and a solid codebase. And I saw a risk factor being as high as 100% for systems that need to talk to some weird unreliable API.</p>

<h3 id="communicate">Communicate</h3>
<p>Communicate your estimate to your steak holders, commit to it and start development. Show progress often and ask for feedback. It allows you to accomplish the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It keeps stakeholders involved</li>
  <li>Stakeholders see your progress</li>
  <li>You can course correct early if anything changes</li>
</ol>

<p>I was once in a situation where a feature set wasn’t presented to a stakeholder properly in the very beginning. As a result, a stakeholder had different expectations. If we would show progress earlier, it would be easier to course correct.</p>

<h3 id="falling-behind-re-negotiate">Falling behind? Re-negotiate</h3>
<p>As with any commitment, here are the only things you can do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fulfill the commitment, or</li>
  <li>Avoid the commitment, or</li>
  <li>Re-negotiate</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that failing to deliver on your commitment is not an option. Even though delivering bad news is uncomfortable, failing to deliver your commitment is even worse. People loose trust in your which is hard to recover from. Do one of the things above instead.</p>

<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>At the end of the days, it all comes down to communication. Chose your words wisely and make sure the other side understands you. You are a part of the team and getting expectations aligned makes everyone’s life easier. There is no harm in delivering even bad updates early. People will appreciate it in the long run. You’ll be off sometimes in your estimation and it’s fine as long as you can communicate clearly and re-negotiate. You’ll get better at estimation over time. You may also notice that estimation takes time. You’ll be in a better place if you take your time to estimate your project properly instead of giving a wrong estimate on the spot. Giving accurate estimates is a crucial soft skill for a <a href="/10-steps-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer/">Senior Software Engineer</a>.</p>

	  <title>Software Engineer Salary: Dollar Dollar Bill Y'All</title>
	  <link>//software-engineer-salary-dollar-dollar-bill-yall</link>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Are software engineers fairly compensated at your company? Do you or your colleagues focus on building the product instead of getting a raise? Everyone needs to be properly incentivised in order for the team to succeed. Fair software developer salary plays a big part in it. After reading this blog post, you’ll know to play this game right.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-a-salary-can-do-for-you-is-make-you-forget-about-it">The best a salary can do for you is make you forget about it</h2>
<p>If you want to know the actual numbers, keep reading till the end. What matters more than numbers is <em>you and your team focusing on building the product</em>. This is how you win. On the other end, trying to maximize your salary is a slippery slope. You can’t win this game because of the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can always find a place that will pay you more</li>
  <li>Focusing on a promotion doesn’t make you a better software engineer</li>
  <li>The company (especially if it’s an early stage startup) has limited cash that will evaporate if everyone in a company focuses on getting more salary</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-higher-salary-doesnt-mean-a-better-job">A higher salary doesn’t mean a better job</h2>
<p>Imagine you’re interviewing at multiple companies and you get an offer that is way above what everyone is willing to pay. You may be excited like this dude:
<img src="/assets/images/excited.gif" alt="Excited dude" async="true" />
If a company wants to pay you a salary significantly above the market, in most cases, there is a reason for it. It may be a big company with a lot of cash and boring work to do. Or the company may be struggling to find people who believe in their mission. Don’t get the high number distract you. Make sure you join a solid team that you can learn from. You’ll spend a lot of time with this group of people every day. Find the company with the vision you believe in. These things matter more than your salary in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<h2 id="ask-for-the-right-number-no-more-no-less">Ask for the right number. No more, no less.</h2>
<p>You should ask for a fair market salary in your geographic area. Look at the salary statistic sites like <a href="https://salary.com" target="blank">salary.com</a> for your experience level and take it as a guiding factor. Don’t accept the offer drastically below or above your current level since you don’t want to be in either of these two situations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You are underpaid. Let’s say you got excited about a new hot startup. You really want to work there but they say they can’t pay you a reasonable salary for some reason. Maybe money is not super important to you because of your lifestyle and you say yes to it. Sooner or later, your friend developer from another company will tell you how much he/she makes and you’ll eventually quit.</li>
  <li>You are overpaid. The employer really wants to hire you and they decide to pay a price above your level. Even though you’ll get paid a lot of money, your employer will have extremely high expectations of you. Most likely, these expectations will be unrealistic and they will be pressured to terminate you after reviewing engineering budget. In addition to it, your colleague at the same company will eventually know that you’re overpaid. News spread out quickly and it will ruin team morale.</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the most important skills to get the right developer salary is a negotiation. I recommend reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0931213207/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=howtoprogramb-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0931213207&amp;linkId=cadf10a661a16a5100bc1d5f9d6dfeed" target="_blank">Negotiating Your Salary: How To Make $1000 a Minute</a>. It explains basic negotiation tactics for salary negotiation. One key advice that I took from this book is to avoid revealing your salary expectations until you make sure it’s the right fit. After being on both sides of the hiring process, I can definitely see how it helps both parties focus on what’s important. Revealing your salary expectations which may or may not fit in a pre-defined budget can be very distracting which can finish a conversation in the very beginning.</p>

<h2 id="how-important-tech-for-your-employer">How important tech for your employer</h2>
<p>Salary negotiation is a two-sided process. Let’s see how it looks from the employer’s perspective. In general, companies can be subdivided into tech companies and non-tech companies. In tech companies, technology plays a crucial role in product development. In other words, if the engineering department disappears, the company is in a big trouble. Engineers are valued in tech companies the most. In this situation, the main focus of the employer is to find top class developers. Every developer makes a massive impact on the business and there is not many great developers available in a current hot job market. You’ll learn the most in such a company and the employer will generally have no problem paying you what you’re worth.</p>

<p>On the other side, in non-tech companies, the main product is powered by an external technology as a service or operationally. Technology is a nice to have addition to the product. In this kind of environment, engineering has a secondary focus in the company. When something is not your primary focus, you would like to get it done cheap and fast. Non-tech companies can afford to hire low-quality talent because of the low technology impact for their business. It’s a good starting point if you are a junior developer. You won’t experience significant growth here and you won’t get paid as much. Make sure you choose the right company for your career stage.</p>

Another reason to become a <a href="https://alextamoykin.com/10-steps-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer/">Senior Software Engineer</a> is a pretty good salary, comparing to the other professions. It depends on many factors. Junior software engineer salary in Los Angeles starts from $80,000 and it may go to $200,000 and above for a principal role at some companies. It depends on many factors like cost of living, geographic area, technical stack, job market etc.</p>

<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>Focus on your growth and the right thing will happen. The company will become stronger because you deliver a better product and your compensation package will grow with it. In a healthy company, it will always be the case. The main asset of the company, especially in the startup world is <em>the team</em>. If your team grows, the company grows. Companies you want to work in understand it and that’s why they have regular performance reviews and promotions.</p>
